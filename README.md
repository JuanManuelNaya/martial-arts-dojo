* For the color scheme:
    - Both navigation and footer have a background color of gold, and the fonts are in black.
    - The aside section on the left has a background color of black, and the fonts are in white.
    - The main section background color is black, the sign-up form background color is grey and the font color is black.
* Both colors and styles on this website are easy to read and fit the idea of the website.
 
6. ## Wireframes
 
* To do a wireframe for this website I use the program Balsamic.
 
7. ## Technologies
 
* GitHub
* GitPod
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
 
 
8. ## Testing
 
* I tested this website and confirm that it works on different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge.
* I confirm that this project is responsive, looks good, and functions on all standard screen sizes using the dev tool device toolbar.
* I confirm that all sections of this website are easy to read and understand.
* I confirm that the form works and displays a message when pressing the submit bottom and entering all requested information  (name, last name, and email.)
* I need to clarify that I do not own a domain. For that reason I created a GET form, when the user puts all the information and submits it, then it will open a new tab with a thank you message.
